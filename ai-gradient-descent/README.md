## The issue of search and basic approaches to it

The aim of the exercise is to implement the simple **gradient descent algorithm** and apply it to find the minimum of the functions f and g. In addition, the effect of
of the step size for different (random) starting points.
Functions (Note: the function g is a two-dimensional function. xi denotes the i-th element of the vector x. The implementation of the algorithm should be one.):

- f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x + 1
- g(x) = 1 âˆ’ 0.6 exp {-x1^2 -x2^2} - 0.4 exp {-(x1 + 1.75)^2 - (x2 - 1)^2}
