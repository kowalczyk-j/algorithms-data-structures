## Evolutionary and genetic algorithms

The aim of the exercise is to implement a genetic algorithm with mutation, selection
roulette, single-point crossover and generational succession. The performance of the algorithm should then be tested using the example of the rocket landing problem.

To do this, find a set of hyperparameters that gives a good result
(at least positive), and then find an examination of the effect of the hyperparameter that you've chosen.
